            <p>
              The Robotics and Intelligent Systems Expo (RISE) aims to be on the
              frontier of showcasing innovation in the fields of robotics and
              autonomy. RISE's primary goal is to immerse attendees in the
              dynamic world of robotics and AI, showcasing the vast
              opportunities in these domains and igniting interest among
              students and faculty. We achieve this through robotics
              demonstrations, enlightening presentations, engaging networking
              sessions, and the presence of industry professionals. In doing so,
              we aim to connect individuals who share a passion for these fields
              while effectively highlighting Purdue University as a pioneering
              institution in the realm of robotics and AI.

              The initial RISE event, held in April 2023, proved to be a
              remarkable success. With 20 participating organizations and over
              200 students in attendance from various disciplines across
              engineering and computer science, it became evident that there is
              a strong interest in robotics and AI-related research and
              activities on campus. Furthermore, the event has garnered
              significant attention from Purdue faculty and the broader research
              community, including undergraduate and graduate students
              passionate about the field.

                The Autonomous Robotics Club of Purdue provides an open space
                for members to explore the field of autonomous robotics through
                building and simulating robotic systems. This hands-on project
                work allows them to apply programming skills, problem-solving
                abilities, and teamwork in a collaborative environment,
                enhancing their practical skills and preparing them for future
                careers in the tech industry. Any Purdue student may join the
                club, without any experience or financial barriers in their way.
                While working on the projects, students are expected to share
                their knowledge with the greater community through outreach
                events and public demonstrations, fostering communication and
                presentation skills.
